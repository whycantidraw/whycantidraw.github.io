So, in case you didn't know (and why would you) - I got a new job. The new job has a twelve month contract which is excellent, since for the past three years I've been on a month-long contract with no idea if I'd still have a job until my contract had lapsed. After getting the phone call about said job, and my current position having a progressively worsening chance of being renewed, I was pretty happy that I would now be on a stable basis, still working at 0.4FTE.
