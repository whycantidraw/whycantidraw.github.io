God damn maintaining a posting schedule is hard when you're flat out. Actually, most things are hard when you're flat out, and maintaining stuff like this is often not my highest priority. The issue is when other things go out the windows (ie. my Instagram posting schedule) - trying to keep that posted and up to date with fresh content when I'm actually producing content should be easy, however the odd hours and bulk binge work often leaves me forgetful and tired.
Anywho, working with Premiere again reminds me of how much fun, and also time consuming video is, and how clunky some of the controls can be - and reminds me that I need to actually add video functionality to this site. Bulk photo update coming soon!
